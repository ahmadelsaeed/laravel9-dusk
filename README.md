### Handling Asset Paths

Assets may not load or display properly when using relative paths due to port specification. Using Larvel's [Path Helpers](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/helpers#available-methods) such as the `url()` and `asset()` helpers  (Ex: `{{ url('path/to/asset.css') }}`) will help overcome these pathing issues.

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
